# Rebuild Experimental Compiler

This project implements features of the Rebuild Language.
The intend is to gain more experience with implementing them in a real compiler.

## State

This project is in a very early stage.
Some unit tests work.

## Usage

This is a C# implementation. We will probably change this.

The REC solution contains a .Net Core projects and regular .Net 4.6.1 projects.
I like to stay compatible with .Net Core, but Resharper works better with classical projects.
Therefore we have both for now. Core projects do not have to be maintained, so it's doable.

## License

We have not decided on the final license of the compiler.
For now we use GPL v3.

For more details read the LICENSE.txt file.

## Contributions

All contributions are welcome.
Please follow the RFC (request for comment) style, to prevent non-merge-able work.
