A compiler written in modern C++, that explores the [Rebuild Language concepts](https://github.com/rebuild-lang/rfcs).

## Requirements

This is a spare time project, we use what makes the job easier and more enjoyable:
* C++17
* CoRoutines-TS (as implemented right now)

Windows:
* Visual Studio 2019
* Qbs 1.13

Linux:
* Clang 8 + libc++
* Qbs 1.13

## Status

As the name of the project implies all of this is experimental and work in progress.
If you like the concepts feel free to participate.

## Contributions

Feel free to create an issue or join [Dresden Weekly](https://www.meetup.com/dresden-weekly) if you want to contribute.
There are a lot of easy tasks left.
